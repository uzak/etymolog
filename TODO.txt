* no default language  (e.g. for some old names)
* `-` in names should be OK
* each languages decides upon lowercase/uppercase

* grouping: group languages
* if word part of a union (sa:bhas) - show derivations of unions too?
* details (sa pur): have multiple comments in rels below each other
* BUG: in ./dict.py if multiple derivations for a word
* language differentiates if case sensitive (e.g. sanskrit)
    and auto translation from devanagari to latin ...
    for english: remove "to" for sorting
* add tests for cli scripts: {details|dict}.py ?

* lookup.py - try to find a word or similar
* caching : redis
* remove Relationship(s).Table
* s/word.derives/word.derives_to/ ???
* support for multiline rel?
* add language to comments?
--
* transitiveness: shall a = b = c also generate a = c? and for ~? -> no
* support for a = b, c = d, e = f (expression in groups) -> no
* add `-` to allowed word chars? -> no, conflicts with DERIVE
* in a group: apply the previous words' lang to all following
  words without explicit lang declaration? -> no
